# Broken Clock IRL

This is an attempt to bring a project by PierreMarTich to life in the real world. After seeing his absolutely terrible [project](https://www.reddit.com/r/badUIbattles/comments/r3q1tl/they_say_that_even_a_broken_clock_is_right_twice/) on [r/badUIbattles](https://www.reddit.com/r/badUIbattles/) I knew I needed one on my wall. 

You can find is original project [here](https://github.com/PierreMarTich/Broken_clock) and I must give him full credit for inspiring this idea.

## Code

### Image
Wrote some trash python with the help of a little chatgpt and we are in business.

**Fun Fact**: The chance of generating the same clock as someone else is â‰ˆ720! or greater than 1 in 2.60e1746.  
### arduino stuff 
more to come here
## Hardware
Plan to use an arduino and a custom led board to get this wired up somehow.
